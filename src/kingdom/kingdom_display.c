/*
 *  kingdom_display.c
 *  Duris
 *
 *  Everything the kingdom code shows a player: the realm status table, the
 *  9x9 territory grid, and the one-line banner the map legend and the room
 *  description hang off.
 *
 *  THIS FILE OWNS NO RULES.
 *
 *  What a realm holds is the single integer highest_claim -- claims
 *  1..highest_claim and nothing else (kingdom_internal.h). Whether a square
 *  may be part of a realm is decided by kingdom_judge_square() and by nothing
 *  else. The display asks both and renders the answers. It never re-derives
 *  either, because two copies of an availability predicate drift apart and it
 *  is always the weaker copy that lies -- here, to the player who is about to
 *  spend six figures of coin on a square the claim code will then refuse.
 *
 *  Text is accumulated with APPENDF()/checked_appendf() (core/safe_format.h),
 *  never with the legacy
 *      snprintf(buf + strlen(buf), CAPACITY - strlen(buf), ...)
 *  idiom. That idiom restates the capacity at every call site (and this tree
 *  historically restated it wrongly), and -Wformat-truncation=2 is fatal in
 *  this build. APPENDF deduces the array's real capacity from its type, tracks
 *  the used offset itself, and truncates rather than overflowing.
