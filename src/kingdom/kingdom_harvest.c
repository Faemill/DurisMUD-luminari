 *  kingdom_harvest.c
 *  Duris
 *
 *  Harvest nodes: REAL OBJECTS scattered at random across the whole world --
 *  the Underdark included -- exactly as the ore and gem mines are, and the
 *  verb that works one.
 *
 *  RULED 2026-09-01 (the SECOND ruling on this module, and it supersedes the
 *  first), IN THREE PARTS
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  The first rewrite made nodes world objects but kept the harvest gated on
 *  land: you could only work a node standing on your own realm's ground.
 *  Review measured what that actually produces -- with nodes spread over the
 *  full map ranges the expected number inside even a maximum 80-square realm
 *  is about 0.07, and because off-realm nodes could never be worked they never
 *  depleted, permanently occupied the region quota, and turned the reload
 *  sweep into a no-op after boot. The owner re-ruled it:
 *
 *    1. NODES LOAD ANYWHERE EXCEPT ON LAND A REALM CONTROLS, and ANYONE may
 *       harvest one. There is no ownership test on the act of harvesting at
 *       all. What a realm gets instead is a YIELD BONUS DERIVED FROM THE TYPE
 *       OF LAND IT CONTROLS -- a realm holding forest works wood better, a
 *       realm holding hills and mountains works mineral better. The yield
 *       banks to the HARVESTER'S OWN realm, not to whoever owns the square.
 *    2. PLACEMENT IS COMPLETELY RANDOM ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD, INCLUDING THE
 *       UNDERDARK, and an Underdark node must be THEMATIC -- a fungal stand,
 *       not a tree. Hence two prototype sets (kingdom_internal.h): 477-480 on
 *       the surface, 481-484 below it. No contradiction with the absolute
 *       Underdark ban: that ban is on siting a REALM, not on where a node may
 *       fall.
 *    3. A PARTIALLY HARVESTED NODE DISAPPEARS after a period. A pristine node
 *       does not rot. See "Decay" below.
 *
 *  WHAT A HARVEST DOES, EXACTLY
 *  ----------------------------
 *  Deposits are NON-WITHDRAWABLE (RULINGS.md, answer 3): nothing here takes a
 *  resource back out of a realm and nothing here hands a player an object. A
 *  completed harvest raises a counter on the harvester's own realm record and
 *  stops.
 *
 *  THREE OUTCOMES, and only the first banks anything:
 *
 *    * The harvester is a full member of a realm that is not in arrears --
 *      the yield is banked to that realm.
 *    * The harvester belongs to no realm -- the ground is still worked, and
 *      the material is left where it lies. THIS IS THE DECISION THE LANE WAS
 *      ASKED TO MAKE, and it follows from the ruling: "anyone may harvest" is
 *      not a permission to harvest if the work is refused, and there is no
 *      player-facing resource item anywhere in this design for the material
 *      to become. Working the ground for nothing is also what keeps turnover
 *      honest -- it is the mechanism the re-ruling exists to restore.
 *    * The harvester's realm is at KARR_NODES_DORMANT or worse -- same as
 *      above, and that is rung 2 of the arrears ladder biting.
 *
 *  A COMPLETED HARVEST ALWAYS SPENDS A CHARGE, in all three cases and even
 *  when the realm's store is at the cap. The previous build refused to spend a
 *  charge when nothing could be banked; that made the ground's depletion
 *  depend on WHO was digging, which is exactly the coupling the re-ruling
 *  removed. One rule now: finishing the work works the ground.
 *
 *  THE KINGDOM BONUS, AND WHY IT IS CACHED
 *  ---------------------------------------
 *  kingdom_terrain_squares() walks the realm's owned squares (claims
 *  1..highest_claim through kingdom_room_for_claim) and tallies how many
 *  favour each resource. Eighty kingdom_room_for_claim() calls -- each a
 *  geometry conversion plus a real_room0() binary search -- on every swing of
 *  every harvester is not a cost worth paying for a number that only changes
 *  when a ring is claimed or reverted, so the tally is cached per realm and
 *  stamped with (realm_id, hall_rnum, highest_claim). Anything that could
 *  change the answer changes the stamp, so there is no invalidation hook to
 *  forget to call.
 *
 *  DECAY
 *  -----
 *  value[2] is 0 on a pristine node and holds the MINUTE the node was first
 *  worked once it has been. KINGDOM_NODE_DECAY_MINS after that it is removed.
 *  Minutes rather than seconds because value[] is int: seconds-since-epoch
 *  overflows a signed 32-bit int in 2038 and minutes do not, ever.
 *
 *  The expiry is LAZY, as ruled: nothing schedules a per-node timer. A node
 *  past its window is invisible to kingdom_node_in_room() from that moment,
 *  and the object is physically removed by whichever comes first -- the
 *  reload sweep (kingdom_nodes_reap) or a player touching the room
 *  (kingdom_node_reap_room).
 *
 *  The same reap also removes any node that has come to stand on land a realm
 *  controls, which is how ruling 1's "except on land a realm controls" stays
 *  true after placement: a realm can claim a ring out from under a node, and
 *  the invariant would otherwise only hold at the instant of spawning. The
 *  quota it was occupying is freed and the sweep re-scatters it elsewhere.
 *
 *  WHAT WAS COPIED FROM mining.c, AND THE THREE THINGS DELIBERATELY NOT
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Copied: the region table's shape and its vnum ranges (mine_data[]), the
 *  spawn loop with its 10000-try budget, the 3/17/55/25 richness distribution
 *  and its charge ranges, the reload-count-from-duris.properties idiom, the
 *  CMD_SET_PERIODIC / CMD_PERIODIC self-extraction proc, and the per-tick
 *  event shape of the action itself.
 *
 *  NOT copied, each for a reason found by reading the engine:
 *
 *    a. mining.c binds its proc with obj_index[real_object0(V)].func.obj.
 *       real_object0() answers 0 BOTH for the first object in the table AND
 *       for "no such vnum" (world/db.c), so if the prototype is missing that
 *       line silently installs the proc on obj_index[0] -- some unrelated
 *       object. All eight prototypes (477-484) are in heavens.obj now, but a
 *       build whose world data lags the code is exactly when the hazard
 *       bites, so this file uses real_object(), which answers -1 for missing,
 *       and skips the binding with a log line.
 *
 *    b. mining.c computes its spawn window as real_room(START)..real_room(END).
 *       real_room() returns NOWHERE (-1) when that EXACT vnum is not a room
 *       (world/db.c), and the very next thing it does is number(start, end)
 *       and then world[to_room] -- a negative index into the world table. This
 *       file finds each region's rnum window by scanning the world table for
 *       rooms whose vnum falls IN the range, so a region whose endpoints do
 *       not happen to exist still works and an empty region is detected
 *       instead of indexed.
 *
 *    c. mining.c does mine->description = str_dup(...) without setting
 *       STRUNG_DESC1, and free_obj() only frees a description when that bit is
 *       set (world/db.c) -- so every mine leaks its description string. This
 *       file sets the bit alongside the assignment.
 *
 *  TWO ENGINE HAZARDS THAT SHAPE THE CODE BELOW
 *  --------------------------------------------
 *  obj_to_room() RETURNS VOID AND CAN DESTROY ITS ARGUMENT. It re-routes a
 *  sinkable object dropped in water to the Poseidon vault, merges a VOBJ_COINS
 *  pile into an existing one and extract_obj()s the loser, and can hand the
 *  object to falling_obj() (world/handler.c). extract_obj() ends in free_obj()
 *  (world/handler.c). Since there is no return value to branch on, EVERY read
 *  of the object is done BEFORE the call and nothing touches it afterwards.
 *  The same rule is why no node pointer is carried across a harvest tick: the
 *  node is re-found by number every time.
 *
 *  extract_obj() FREES, so no list is walked while extracting from it. The
 *  reaps collect into a vector (or read next_content before extracting) and
 *  extract afterwards.

 * The region table
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The vnum ranges are mine_data[]'s own (economy/mining.c), so that nodes and

 * the other's shape.
 *
 * A REGION CARRIES ONE TOTAL, NOT A QUOTA PER RESOURCE (ruled 2026-09-03 after
 * the first live test: "there are way too many nodes in game"). The earlier
 * table kept a separate population of each resource in each region, which both
 * over-filled the world -- 225 nodes standing at once -- and made the mix
 * deterministic: a surface sweep always ended with exactly forty stone seams,
 * wherever they landed. Now each region keeps a single population and every
 * node placed into it rolls its OWN resource, so what is standing at any moment
 * is a genuinely random mix that drifts as nodes are worked out and replaced.
 *
 * The counts are deliberately small. Forty nodes across the whole surface map
 * and thirty through the Underdark means finding one is worth something; a
 * gatherer who works one out has removed a real share of the world's supply
 * until the next sweep replaces it somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * Each total is overridable from duris.properties by the key spelled out beside
 * it -- written in full rather than composed at runtime, so a grep of the
 * properties file and a grep of the source find the same string.
 *
 * ON THE UNDERDARK: its counts used to be token, justified by the claim that an
 * Underdark node could never be banked because no realm may be sited on an
 * Underdark square. The re-ruling killed that reasoning -- harvesting is not
 * tied to the ground you stand on, so an Underdark node banks to the digger's
 * realm exactly as a surface one does -- and its own thematic prototypes
 * (481-484) are what spawn there.
 *
 * THE THARNADIA RIFT IS NOT A REGION (ruled 2026-09-03). It carried a token ten
 * nodes and was dropped outright: nodes belong in the open world, not seeded
 * into a zone of that shape. Removing it is why no vnum window below 500000 is

 * room and by kingdom_nodes_reap() on the sweep.
 *

 * has gone -- extract_obj() detaches an object's events before free_obj(). The
