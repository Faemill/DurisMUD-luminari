/*
 *  kingdom.h
 *  Duris
 *
 *  THE SEAM. This is the only kingdom header any file outside src/kingdom/
 *  may include, and everything below is the whole surface the rest of the
 *  server is allowed to touch. Internals live in kingdom_internal.h.
 *
 *  WHAT A KINGDOM IS
 *  -----------------
 *  A guild that has converted to a kingdom owns map squares in four
 *  concentric rings around its guildhall entrance -- 8, 16, 24 then 32
 *  squares, 80 in total. A ring must be completed before the next opens, and
 *  within a ring the squares are claimed in a fixed clockwise order starting
 *  due north. The geometry lives in kingdom_geometry.h.
 *
 *  BECAUSE THAT ORDER IS FIXED, a realm's territory is described by a SINGLE
 *  INTEGER: the highest claim index it holds. Squares 1..highest_claim are
 *  owned and nothing else is. There is no per-square ownership table, no
 *  80-row write per realm, and reverting a ring for unpaid upkeep is just
 *  lowering that integer to a ring boundary.
 *
 *  ENABLEMENT
 *  ----------
 *  The subsystem is gated at runtime by lib/kingdom.cfg (kingdom.enabled),
 *  not by a compile flag. With it off, kingdom_enabled() is false, every
 *  command answers "kingdoms are not enabled", and -- importantly --
 *  kingdom_footprint_check() permits everything, so guildhall placement
 *  behaves exactly as it did before this module existed.
